/**
 * @name Events
 * @description
 * Events is a publish-subscribe style event system for sending and responding to application-level
 * events across your app.
 *
 * @usage
 * ```ts
 * import { Events } from 'ionic-angular';
 *
 * // first page (publish an event when a user is created)
 * constructor(public events: Events) { }
 *
 * createUser(user) {
 *   console.log('User created!')
 *   this.events.publish('user:created', user, Date.now());
 * }
 *
 *
 * // second page (listen for the user created event after function is called)
 * constructor(public events: Events) {
 *   events.subscribe('user:created', (user, time) => {
 *     // user and time are the same arguments passed in `events.publish(user, time)`
 *     console.log('Welcome', user, 'at', time);
 *   });
 * }
 *
 * ```
